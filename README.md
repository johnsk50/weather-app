# Assignment

## Description

We'd like you to create a small weather dashboard where the user can:
 - Input one or more cities (though an autocomplete or selection from a list)
 - View the current temperature and weather conditions of each the cities (in a list or a grid or anything, also an icon would be nice)
 - Favorite one or more cities so when they visit the app again the temperatures for those cities will be there (with updated info)

## Installation

 - Clone or download the project
 - Run `npm install`
 - Run `ng serve` for the dev server
 - Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

# Development

 - The `src/app/data/cities.ts` contains a list of hardcoded city data (the model is in  `src/app/models/city.ts`) 
 - In the `src/app/models/api` there are some interfaces that model the API responses

## Weather API info

 - Docs: `https://openweathermap.org/current`
 - Icons: `https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions`

### Have fun :)
